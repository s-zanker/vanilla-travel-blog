            It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of
            a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long
            Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random
            allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,
            “My God! Mr. Chace, what is the matter?” I answered, “we have been
            stove by a whale.” —“Narrative of the Shipwreck of the Whale Ship
            Essex of Nantucket, which was attacked and finally destroyed by a
            large Sperm Whale in the Pacific Ocean.” By Owen Chace of Nantucket,
            first mate of said vessel. New York, 1821.

            It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of
            a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long
            Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random
            allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,
            sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least,
            take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in
            these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As
            touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here
            appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as
            affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously
            said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and
            generations, including our own.
